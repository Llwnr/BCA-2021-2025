Memory Allocation
    Memory allocation can be done in 2 ways :-

    Changeable          ==>     We use variable as changeable memory allocation

    Unchangeable        ==>     We use constant as unchangeable memory allocation


In C language we indicate :-

    Input       ==>     scanf("")

    Output      ==>     printf("")

NOTE:

    DATA TYPE           |   Syntax          |   Description

1.  INTEGER             |   int             |   used to include integer ranging FROM -32768 TO 32768
