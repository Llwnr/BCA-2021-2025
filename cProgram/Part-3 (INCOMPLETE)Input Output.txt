Memory Allocation
    Memory allocation can be done in 2 ways :-

    Changeable          ==>     We use variable as changeable memory allocation

    Unchangeable        ==>     We use constant as unchangeable memory allocation


In C language we indicate :-

    Input       ==>     scanf("")

    Output      ==>     printf("")

//  NOTE: THESE ARE GENERALLY USED DATA TYPES

    DATA TYPE           |   Syntax          |   Format      |       Description

1.  INTEGER             |   int             |   %d          |       used to include integer number only ranging FROM -32768 TO 32768

2.  FLOAT               |   float           |   %f          |       used to include decimal numbers as well as integer number

3.  CHARACTER           |   char            |   %s          |       can include alphabetical characters as well

    int a = 10, b, c ;

    float x = 1.5, y, z;

    char firstName, lastName ;

    // THIS IS FOR INTEGER
    scanf("Enter the value of b = %d", &b);
    c = a + b ;
    printf("Value of c = %d", c);

    // THIS IS FOR FLOAT
    scanf("Enter the value of y = %f", &y);

    printf("Value of z = %f", z);

    // THIS IS FOR STRING
    scanf("Enter your FIRST NAME = %")
